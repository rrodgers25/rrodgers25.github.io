      <p>
        Tourist Attractions in New York City are known throughout the world. 
        The tourist population in New York is highest in the summer and around the holidays, though it stays dynamic year-round. Tourists numbers are largest around the oldest, most iconic attractions found in Manhattan, such as the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Central Park or the Brooklyn Bridge. In the last 20 years, tourists are increasingly visiting attractions that are less iconic than the traditional, such as Flushing Meadows Corona Park, less crowded beaches, and attractions found in northern areas of the Bronx, areas further east in Brooklyn and Queens.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The New York City subway system was built in the 1930s.  It contains 26 separate metro lines and nearly 500 stations. When traveling long lines such as the N, W, F, 4, 5, 6, A, E lines from the northern-most to the southern-most station, the total trip time can take approximately two hours. </p>


        <p> In the 1930s, subway lines were strategically placed to extend past areas with large populations to accomodate future projections of growth and urban sprawl. Subway lines do reach many areas that are considered 'further out.'  Though tourists are increasingly visiting attractions that are less accessible by subway. </p>

        <p>Which New York City tourist sites are accessible by subway and which are not?
        Below is a map of all of the tourist sites and subway stations. Some are not visited by tourists as heavily as New Yorkers; they are considered areas of interest. Although subway lines do cover a large area, past a certain point, especially in eastern, southeastern Queens and southeastern Brooklyn, subways can only get you so far. Here, buses become the most reliable form of public transportation. </p>

        Hover or click on each red data point to see the name of the tourist attraction. </p>
